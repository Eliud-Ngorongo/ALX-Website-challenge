    <br>
    
    <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>Add cooking oil to you pan and wait for it to get warm then add your onions.
           Sprinkle the sugar on your onions and cover them over low heat.Allow to cook for about 4 minutes.
           Remove your lid and stir your onions so that they mix well with the sugar, add 1/4 cup of water and cover again.
           Remove your lid after 3 minutes and your onions will now be caramelized and smell amazing. Add your tomatoes and some hot water and cover again for about 5 minutes
           After the tomatoes are well cooked add your curry powder,ginger,honey,garlic pepper and mix well.Allow this to cook for 5 minutes on low heat. 
          The result should be a thick paste. On achieving this add your pork and stir well so that the sauce covers the pork.
          Add your soy sauce at this point and mix well.Notice we did not add salt since dark soy sauce is naturally salty.
          Cover this and cook for 20 minutes on medium heat.After the time has elapsed uncover the meat and take it off the burner. Sprinkle your dhania stems evenly on top of the meat,cover and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
          Serve with either a portion of basmati rice or Mukimo with some kachumbari.ENJOY!!!</p>
