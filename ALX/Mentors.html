            <h1>My Parents</h1>
             <p> My parents are the greatest example of God's grace,hardwork and wits that I have in my life.
             They were born into very poor backgrounds, resources were scarce and they had to get by with the little they had.
             This was a time when a loaf of bread was a delicacy and reserved for the rich, chapatis were only seen during christmas and that too was not a guarentee.
             Survival was the only thing available.
             Faced with tremendous challenges they still overcame this and built a life I would be glad to emulate.</p>
            <h2>Dad's Story</h2>
              <p> The name is Peter Njenga Magondu, born November 14,1958 to Mr and Mrs Samuel Magondu. He is the second born out four children.
                At the age of 17 he had already started formal employment as a driver.(A role he still hold and cherishes to this day).
                By age 26 he had already built his first house,consisting mainly of iron sheets. This stood out because at the time such houses were only built by teachers.
                Some even accused him of being a thief to which he said they should also join him if that is what they think will also give them the same.</p>
              <br>    
               <p>Here is how he did it:</p>
            
                <p>From his meagre salary at the time,he would take a percentage and buy materials step by step until he had accumulated all the iron sheets, timber and sand he needed.
                   All he had to do now was get a contractor and in no time ha had a house that would get him referred to as a thief.He did all this with a driver's salary that was no more than 200 Kenya Shillings.
                   200 KENYAN SHILLINGS!!!! THATS MERELY 2 DOLLARS.</p>
                <br>   
                <p>He knew that his salary wasnt enough and he needed to do more and his entrepreneurial spirit kicked in and he opened a small kiosk selling basic items at a small margin.
                   He has always been a hardworker and always thinks of tomorrow and how he can make it better while ever remaining humble.This is a man who uses the same serviette twice: Once after he washes his hands before eating and second after washing his hands after eating.
                   How many do you use?? </p>
            <h2>Mum's Story</h2>
                <p> Margaret Njeri Njenga is the 3rd born to Mr and Mrs Eliud Ngorongo Thiongo born December 13 1966.At the age of 21 she became a mother, a wife and a business lady.
                    She is the one of the few people I know who has never been employed her entire life. <p>She has been a tailor,shopkeeper,truck driver and so much more.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that all this happened while she was still raising a family.</p><p>She is the living embodiment of "Dont let what they say about you stop you".</p>
                <p>I remember this one time she was home alone and the cows didnt have any hay or napier grass to eat but an old lorry my dad had was parked there, so what does she do??:....
                She got into the lorry(mind you its a manual gear box),drove a few kilometters away and got someone to help her load the grass, went back home and fed the cows.Incredible!!</p>             
                  <p>For the last 20 or so years she has been in the animal feeds distribution business which is primarily a man dominated field. However she has been able to stand on her own 
                    and tough it out with them all. TRUE IRON LADY.</p>
                <p> She has a wealth of knowledge in the "Juakali" industry and always has insight regardless of the sector and this is pure instinct brought on by years of being in business.
                </p>
            <h3>Lessons</h3>
                <p> I am really lucky that I do not have to look far for mentors and great examples of pure hardwork and determination: They are just a conversation away.
                    The greatest lesson I have learnt so far include:</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Life has no vacuum. There is no in between;Everything you do has either a positive or negative outcome and life rewards you based on the same. The choice is ours to make.</li>
                         <li>You reap what you sow. A mango seed in a packet wiljobl always remain just that,a seed.
                             But if its planted it either grows or withers depending on the input to it.
                             Such is our life, whatever decisions we make for our lives lead to either prosperity or downfall.
                          </li>
                         <li>People without vision perish. Simple and straight forward.If you do not know where you are going how will you know when you get there??.
                             Similarly if you decide to go one way and take the wrong path you will never get to your destination.
                         </li>
                         <li> Discipline is the begining of wisdom:Self discipline is a trait so many claim to have yet so few of us practice.
                             Without it we never really become wise and just end up living a lie to please our peers.
                         </li>
                         <li>Start small,Dream Big, Never give up. My mom had a sticker on the dashboard of a lorry that read :"FORWARD EVER BACKWARD NEVER".
                             This rings true to this day,they have always moved one step up in life ever so steadily and with finese.
                         </li>
                         <li>Get out of your comfort zone!!. When we choose to do the hard things in life we are rewarded with the gifts of:
                             <ul><p>
                             <li> Perserverance.</li>
                             <li>Self Confidence.</li>
                             <li>Learning how to think.</li>
                             </ul>
                             <p>
                            A ship in port is safe BUT that's not what ships are built for: Let that sink in.
                </p>
