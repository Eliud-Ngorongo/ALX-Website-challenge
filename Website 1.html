<h1> Ngorongo's  Blog: Whos is Ngorongo</h1>
<br>
<p> 
  My name is Eliud Ngorongo Njenga a financical and risk analyst from Nairobi Kenya.</p>
  <p>
    When I finished high school I didnt really know what career path to take (something most of you can relate I am sure) sow I went with the most prestigious course I knew:Actuarial Science.
I was fairly good in math but my real passion was computers.Most of my time in campus was spent in the computer lap albiet just to download movies.</p>
<p>After graduating I didnt get employment at any Actuarial related firm and I slowly lost all hope of ever working in the actuarial field.
This whole time my itch for computers was still there and I decided to try and teach myself some form of code with help from my brother. 
I wasnt really committed to it until he sent me the ALX application and I realised what an amazing opportunity this could be. </p>
<br>
<h2> MY MISSION </h2>
<p>
  Growing up I was exposed to the world of transport by my parents business. They expereinced alot of challenges from sourcing lorries to the reapir and maintenance  of the same
  I developed a keen interest for logistics as well as travel and I would like to enhance reliability and access to this industry and I believe technology is at the helm of this solution.
  </p>
<h3>MY VISION</h3>
<p>
  My personal vision is to have a life of meaning for myself and others. 
  It is important for me to live my life in a way that shows kindness, care, and concern for family and friends and even strangers.</p>
  <p>
  Earning respect for myself based on recognition of my accomplishments and abilities, maintains a sense of appreciation of the beauty of nature, and a sense of humor.</p>
